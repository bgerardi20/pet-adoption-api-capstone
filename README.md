## Background
//I really like sweet, delicious coffee and thought it would be interesting to see what kinds of coffee drinks are available around the world.
My entire life I have been a animal lover, but could never find the perfect one to adopt. With this app, that problem with cease to exist, as you are able to search thousands of images, to help with picking out which one is best for you. Once you found that perfect breed, hop on over to the adoption section and find one close to you!
## Use Case
//This app includes 20 different coffee drinks from different countries. A person can read through the descriptions, view the images and choose a coffee. An overlay will then show where the coffee can be found, two YouTube videos on how to make it and some coffee trivia from Wikipedia.
